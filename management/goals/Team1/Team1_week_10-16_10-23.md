## Goals

1. AI ship with simple pathfinding movement.
    * Theta Star: (Pathfinding algorithm)
    * Boolean Representation of Map (1 if object)
    * AI ship follows path from left side of star to right side of star
2. Gravity for Physics
    * Objects implement class, and update sprite class. (Might depend on level gen.)
    * Add a star and have ship move towards it over time.
3. Frame Independent for Physics
    * Implement the time data class in sprite class.
    * Show uptick time differentials.
4. Randomized Space Object Tiles for Level Gen.
    * Fix the implementation so it can be outputted to main file.
5. Procedurally Generated Maze for Level Gen.
    * Maze will be outputted to console as ASCII
    * Implement in level gen environment as separate class or implement into used class
6. Working Movement for Maze for Level Gen.
    * Ship moves through maze
    * Use basic movement separate from physics team.
