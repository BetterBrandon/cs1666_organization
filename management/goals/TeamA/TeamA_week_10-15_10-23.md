## Goals

1. Animate explosions
2. finish firing mechanics for player and enemy
3. improve enemy movement mechanics (ai)
	a) restrict regular enemy movement to left side of window
	b) have "kamakaze" plane movement (track player and try to collide and keep flying if missed)
4. drop cave hazards when shot (physics)
5. randomly generate cave hazards (RLG)
