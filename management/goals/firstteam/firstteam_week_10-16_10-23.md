## Goals

1. AI - Come up with fun additions to the enemy tanks, like different sizes, speed, extra abilities, and work towards implementing them
2. Random Level Gen - Research and work on Procedural Generation presentation. Begin research towards implementing a maze generating algorithm
3. Networking - Work towards getting two separate games to connect with each other locally using command arguments; not necessarily any game state transfers, but a confirmation that another player has connected
