# Advanced Topic Presentations

## Presentation 1 (10/28):

  * Briefly mention some general real world applications with AI and then segue into game AI
  * Introduce the basic goals of video game AI:
      * What do we do to create a fun AI to play with?
      * Goal to make AI appear human controlled?
        * Make the AI react as a human would based on situation or act in the most beneficial way to its goal
      * Cheating AI a good idea?
  * Dive a bit deeper into Game AI
    * Dynamic AI through changes in state and behavior  
      * Finite State Machines
      * State Transition Tables
    * AI pathfinding
      * Obstacle avoidance, pursuit, dodging, etc
      * Detection boxes
        * Invisible collisions with objects will help to inform the AI on what to do next.
    * Using Decision Trees for NPCs
  * Possible ideas, solutions, and expected problems to our implementation
    * Using graphs to navigate the game world
      * This could be especially effective when the environment is effectively generated once


## Prsentation 2 (11/11):

  * Continuation of explaining beginner concepts that first group presents on
      * Ex. How AI is needed for video games to be fun/interactive 
  * Learning
      * Different forms of learning
          * Intra-Behavior, Inter-Behavior
      * Action Prediction
          * N-grams?
      * Decision learning
  * AI in our game
      * Explain how we got the enemy plane to follow at first
      * Explain why traditional path-finding algorithms (i.e. the ones involving Dijkstra’s or A* algorithm) aren’t the best choice for path-finding for the enemy plane
          * Introduce risk scoring algorithm
  * Future Plans for AI in our game
      * Possible enhancements to risk scoring algorithm
      * Can explain some concepts that are in the book provided in the AI sub chat

## Presentation 3 (12/2):
