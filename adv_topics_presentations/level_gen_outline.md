# Procedural Level Generation Advanced Topic Presentations

## Presentation 1 (10/23):

## Prsentation 2 (11/6):
*Begin by shortly explaining our group's game and how procedural level generation will be used in Galaxy and Maze Generation 
*Galaxy Generation
  *Explain why this problem can be/needs to be solved with Procedural Generation
  *Show algorithms that can solve this problem
  *Poisson Disc Sampling Algorithm
    *What does it do and how does it work?
    *How does it relate back to galaxy generation?
    *Pros and Cons
    *Why didn't we pick this to solve our problem?
  *Random Number Generators
    *What do they do and how do they work?
    *Different types
    *Which one should we use for our case?
    *Limitations?
*Maze Generation
  *What defines a good maze? a bad maze?
  *What parameters do we have to account for?
  *What makes an algorithm good for maze generation?
  *Wilson's Algorithm
    *Deep dive into how it works (complexity, runtime, etc. )
    *Why it's good for maze generation
    *Why we chose not to implement it
  *Eller's Algorithm
    *Deep Dive into how it works
    *Advantages and Disadvantages of Eller's Algorithm, including implementation challenges.
    *Why we chose to implement this over other algorithms
